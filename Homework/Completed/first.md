### July 1, 2020

Hello all! This is just a brief paragraph of myself and my background. I
am currently an Active Duty Marine. My time in service is coming to an end 
this November. During my time in I was a Data Network Administrator meaning 
basically anything IT related. I did things ranging from helpdesk all the 
way to building a network from the ground up. Some of my skills include:

* CUCM
* Windows 2012 & 2016
* Exchange
* Active Directory
* ACAS
* Nessus



Aside from those techinical skills I also have managerial skills, leadership skills, and can work well in a team environment. If you hire me 
you will not regret it!
