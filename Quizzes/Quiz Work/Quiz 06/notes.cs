//1. Declare an integer array of 52 elements.

//2. Initialize the array with integers 0 through 51.

//3. Write a void method that accepts an integer argument of 0 through 51 
//and prints the card value of the integer, i.e., 0 will print Two of Clubs, 1
//will print Three of Clubs, 50 will print King of Spades, 51 will print Ace of 
//Spades, and so on.Aces high.

//4. Print the card value of each element of the array.

//5. Create four hands: North, East, South, and West.

//6. \Deal" the cards into each hand, 13 cards to a hand. The cards must be dealt 
//randomly and each card can be dealt once and only once.

//7. Print the hands.
//Hints: i % 13 = value, i = 13 = suit, i = 4 = hand.Here is my output.
